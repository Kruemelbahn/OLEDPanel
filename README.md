# OLEDPanel

This is a simple library for OLED Type SH1106 for usage with Arduino-platform.<br>

The library encapsulates and expands the original OLED-files into a new class 'OLEDPanel'.<br>

This library also includes functionality for button-states which gives more functionality to the new designed PCB.<br>
Tested on ATmega328.
