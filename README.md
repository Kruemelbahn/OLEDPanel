# OLEDPanel

This is a simple library for OLED SH1106 for usage with Arduino-platform.<br>

The library encapsulates and expands the OLED-library (original source written by M.KÃ¶hler, https://github.com/Sylaina/oled-display.git)
into class 'OLEDPanel'.<br>

This library also includes functionality for button-states which gives more functionality on the new designed PCB.<br>
Tested on ATmega328.
